# ${{\color{#980DC9}\Huge{\textsf{Descriptive Cell Type Naming Application}}}}\$ 

# Overview
The full application takes post-clustering flow or mass cytometry expression data as the input, returns marker definitions per cluster (Part 1), standardizes marker names (Part 2), and finally matches to cell type names (Part 3).

Post-clustered expression data is inputted via the Input Expression Data tab within the application. If the user prefers to directly input marker descriptions (e.g. CD4+, CD8-) and skip Part 1, they can do so through the Input Marker Descriptors tab.
